# Why Creator Attribution Should Be Native to Android

## The Gap
Android secures devices, apps, and users —
but not creation itself.

Today, Android natively protects:
- Devices (keystore, TEE)
- Identities (accounts, biometrics)
- Applications (signing, permissions)

But creative output — art, code, writing, invention —
has no native trust primitive.

## The Opportunity
Creation is a trust event.

If Android can:
- Timestamp installs
- Sign applications
- Bind keys to hardware

Then Android can also:
- Timestamp creation
- Bind authorship to devices
- Surface attribution as a system signal

HoboFrancs introduces this missing layer.

## What HoboFrancs Adds (Without Breaking Anything)
HoboFrancs does NOT replace:
- Copyright law
- Google Play policies
- Existing certificate authorities

Instead, it introduces:
- Device-bound creator certificates
- Cryptographic proof-of-creation
- Optional, opt-in attribution metadata

All implemented using existing Android primitives.

## Why Android Specifically
Android is:
- Open
- Global
- Creator-heavy
- OEM-diverse

A native creator attribution layer:
- Strengthens Android’s creator economy
- Reduces IP disputes upstream
- Adds provenance signals for AI, media, and apps
- Positions Android as the first OS to respect authorship by default

## Trust Evolution Path
1. User-generated creator certificates (Today)
2. Platform-verified intermediates (Future)
3. Delegated creator root trust (Long-term)

No shortcuts. No impersonation. No security theater.

## Strategic Alignment
HoboFrancs aligns with:
- Android Keystore
- Play Integrity
- Device-bound trust
- Responsible AI provenance

## End State
When something is created on Android,
attribution exists by default.

Not enforced.
Not monetized.
Just true.

That is a stronger internet.
