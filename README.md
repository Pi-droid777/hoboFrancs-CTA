# HoboFrancs Vision

HoboFrancs is architected to become a
Creator Root Certificate Authority (CRCA).

Our long-term vision is to embed creator attribution,
proof-of-existence, and ownership signals at the lowest
trust layer of digital systems — the certificate layer.

## Today
- User-generated certificates
- Device-bound proof-of-creation
- Cryptographic timestamps
- Voluntary verification

## Tomorrow
- Platform-recognized certificates
- Installer-level attribution
- OEM integrations
- Root trust delegation for creators

## End State
Creation itself becomes a trust event.
Attribution becomes native.
Ownership becomes automatic.
