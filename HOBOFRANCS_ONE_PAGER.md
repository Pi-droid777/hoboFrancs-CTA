# HoboFrancs
Creator Root Certificate Infrastructure (Beta)

## The Problem
The internet made creation instant —
but attribution fragile.

Creators can prove *they posted* something,
but not *that they created it* — especially across devices,
platforms, and time.

Copyright is slow.
Patents are expensive.
Platforms control attribution.

## The Solution
HoboFrancs introduces Certificate-Triggered Attribution (CTA):
a cryptographic proof-of-creation system architected to evolve
into a Creator Root Certificate Authority (CRCA).

Creation becomes a trust event.
Attribution becomes native.
Ownership becomes automatic.

## How It Works (Today)
- Creator generates a CTA certificate
- Work is hashed + timestamped
- Certificate is device-bound
- Proof lives locally (with optional verification)

## How It Evolves (Tomorrow)
- Platform-verified intermediates
- Installer & keystore integration
- OEM trust delegation
- Creator Root Certificate Authority

## Why This Matters
- Proof without lawyers
- Attribution without platforms
- Ownership without permission

HoboFrancs does not replace copyright or patents —
it creates a cryptographic **first mile of trust**.

## Monetization
- $5 Basic Proof (Beta)
- Pro & Studio tiers (verification, collaboration)
- Enterprise & OEM licensing

## Market
- Independent creators
- Inventors & developers
- Creative platforms
- Device manufacturers

## Status
Beta / Proof-of-Concept  
Open-source core, trust-layer roadmap

## Vision
If something is created,
attribution should exist by default.
